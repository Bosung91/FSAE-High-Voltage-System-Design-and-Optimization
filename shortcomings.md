# Shortcomings
## Precharge Resistor Diagnosis
<p style='text-align: justify'>
The diagnosis is entirely based on engineering guess as there were no sensors installed in R25Evo to monitor temperature of Precharge resistors. Some form of data logging must be done for 26 Precharge-Discharge PCB to ensure the proposed solution is effective.

## Altium SPICE Simulation
<p style='text-align: justify'>
SPICE simulation has been run for the first time using Altium Designer, which casts doubt on result accuracy. Real life tests need to be conducted to validate simulation results.
