# Design Statement and Problem Definition

## Design Statement
The NUS FSAE team's goal for R26e is to achieve consistent performance in the endurance event through enhanced reliability to raise the team's overall ranking.  

Thus, to achieve the team's goal, the design statement for the HV department would be:  
_'To design and optimize HV system to be **rule-compliant**, **reliable** and **safe**.'_

## Problem Definition
Based on R25e's performance in Formula SAE EV 2025, the following problems regarding the motor controller (BAMOCAR) surfaced.

### Outdated
The team has been using the same BAMOCAR (released in 2016) for over four consecutive years, which led to a challenge in receiving technical support and resulted in frequent breakdowns, causing the team to replace major components such as IGBT and main control board for at least five times.

### Heavy
BAMOCAR is heavy relative to performance oriented motor controllers in the market currently.

### Current Limited
The motor the team is using, EMRAX 228 MV, is rated for a maximum output of 340A, while BAMOCAR is rated for a maximum output of 220A only.

Due to the above problems, and after much research and discussion, the team has decided to use CM200DX motor controller for R26e.

### CM200DX

CM200DX is newer, lighter than BAMOCAR by 1.6 kg, and has higher maximum output rating of 740 A<sub>rms</sub>.
