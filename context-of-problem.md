# Context of Problem

Based on R25E's performance in Formula SAE EV 2025, the team identified that motor controller (BAMOCAR D3 400-400) is performance limited.

## Current Limited
The motor the team is using, EMRAX 228 MV, is rated for a maximum output of 340A, while BAMOCAR is rated for a maximum output of 220A only.

## Transition to CM200DX
Due to the limited current ramp rate of Bamocar, the team has decided to use CM200DX motor controller for R26e.
