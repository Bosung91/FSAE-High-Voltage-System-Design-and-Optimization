# Objective and Scope

## Objective
The team competed in the FSAE EV category in June 2025 and achieved an overall position of 7th out of 79 teams, 4 places higher than the last competition. Well-balanced improvement in efficiency, dynamic and static events helped the team achieve such result. However, the team realised there are still potentials to increase the car's performance for acceleration and endurance events. Thus, the R26e team aims to build on R25e's capability.

## HV Deparment Job Scope
This report primarily focuses on High Voltage (HV) system of R26e, which comprises Precharge-Discharge PCB, Tractive Battery PDM PCB, HV Distribution PCB, PCB enclosures and wiring.
