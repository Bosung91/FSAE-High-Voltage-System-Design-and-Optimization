# Objective and Scope

## Objective
The team competed in the FSAE EV category in June 2025 and achieved an overall position of 7th out of 79 teams, 4 places higher than the last competition. Well-balanced improvement in efficiency, dynamic and static events helped the team achieve such result. However, the team realised there are still potentials to increase the car's performance for endurance event. Thus, the R26e team aims to build on R25e's capability in dynamic events.

## Team Goal
