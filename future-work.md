# Future Work
## R26E Testbench
<p style='text-align: justify'>
R26E testbench will be designed to validate functionalities of all HV PCBs and monitor Precharge resistor temperature by using either a temperature probe, infrared thermometer or thermistor.
</p>

## R26E Test Run
<p style='text-align: justify'>
R26E test runs will be conducted to validate stability of wire harness connections to HV PCBs, and log Precharge resistor operating temperature using thermistor to validate the effectiveness of revamped 26 Precharge-Discharge PCB.
